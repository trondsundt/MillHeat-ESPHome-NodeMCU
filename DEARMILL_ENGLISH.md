# A Frustration-Fueled Tale of Millheat Wi-Fi Connected Heaters

Dear Millheat,

I want to start by expressing my deep frustration and disappointment with the way your Wi-Fi connected heaters are designed and perform. I've purchased a total of six of these heaters, and I've had to return and replace eight of them. The experience has been nothing short of a nightmare, and I feel compelled to share my story in the hopes of shedding light on the issues I've encountered.

My journey with your heaters began with a glimmer of hope, as I was excited about the prospect of remotely controlling and scheduling my heating system. However, my enthusiasm quickly turned into regret, and my feelings of frustration have only intensified over time.

The connectivity issues are beyond aggravating. I've had to set up and reconnect each heater around seven times on average for them to work properly. And even when they do start working, they seem to have a mind of their own, as they stop functioning correctly approximately 50% of the time. This means that for every two heaters I have, only one actually works as intended, and the other half become frustrating, expensive paperweights.

Your approach to creating these connected devices strikes me as extremely cheap, lacking the reliability and user-friendliness that one would expect. It's evident that the design and implementation of your Wi-Fi connectivity are severely flawed, causing immense frustration and disappointment for customers like me.

I thought I could find a way to work around the issues. Last year, I was content with the situation and almost managed to forget the struggles. However, as the weather got colder and it was time to bring the heaters out of storage, I quickly realized that nothing had changed. The problems persisted, and I had to go through the tedious process of troubleshooting all over again.

I tried everything in my power to make your heaters work, including creating new accounts, using different email addresses, and even testing them in different houses with varying Wi-Fi setups from different vendors. To my dismay, nothing worked. The realization that your system was consistently unreliable became increasingly frustrating, leaving me feeling helpless and trapped by a faulty product.

The breaking point came when I discovered that I could take matters into my own hands and solve this problem independently. By connecting a NodeMCU chip, which is incredibly cost-effective, I found a way to control the heaters more efficiently than your Millheat system ever could. This revelation was both liberating and infuriating, as it made me question why I had ever invested in your products in the first place.

I want to make it explicitly clear that I will never purchase another Mill product, and I will actively discourage others from doing so. The level of frustration and wasted time I've endured is unparalleled. In fact, I believe that Millheat should recall every single one of these heaters ever sold and refund customers like me, who have spent countless hours troubleshooting this unreliable, frustrating, and ultimately unsatisfactory product.

In total, I estimate that I've spent well over 300 hours attempting to make your heaters work as they should. This entire experience has been a horrific and time-consuming ordeal, leaving me with a profound sense of disappointment and regret.

I sincerely hope that this feedback reaches your product development and customer service teams. Millheat's Wi-Fi connected heaters have caused me immense frustration and inconvenience, and I hope that my story serves as a wake-up call for your company to improve the quality and reliability of your products.

Sincerely,

Trond Sundt
